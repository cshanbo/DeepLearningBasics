This project contains Machine Learning basics wrote by myself

1. Logistic Regression
    1. Multi-class Logistic Regression (2-class also supported)
    2. Written in C++ 11

2. Hiddenlayer
    1. Hiddenlayer for mlp (feedforward neural network)
    2. could be used anywhere you want
    3. activate function includes:
        1. tanh
        2. sigmoid
        3. ReLU

2. Multi-layer Perceptron (Feedforward NN)
    1. Single hidden layer MLP
    2. mini-batch supported

3. Retricted Boltzmann Machine
    1. First commit, bug fixing
